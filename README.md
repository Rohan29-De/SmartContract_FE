# SmartContract_FE

This repository contains my Metacrafters frontend DApp project that interacts with a Solidity smart contract deployed on the local Ethereum network. The DApp allows users to perform deposit and withdraw operations and also includes additional functionalities like calculating factorials and checking palindromes.

## Features

1. **Deposit**: Users can deposit a specified amount into the smart contract.
2. **Withdraw**: Users can withdraw a specified amount from the smart contract.
3. **CheckPalindrome**: Users cancheck if the input amount is palindrome or not.
4. **CheckFactorial**: Users can check the factorial of the input amount from the smart contract.
5. **Balance**: Users can view the balance in the smart contract.
